## Nushell Scripts Readme

This is a collection of scripts that I wrote while learning [nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell) scripting that started with `nushell` `0.24.2` with multiline scripts and continues to move toward maturity with version `0.25.2`.

Most of these scripts are in the `nushell` language but some are from bash or powershell or whatever. Any interesting script I found I put in here for porting. Some scripts are inserted as comments in the `.nu` files.

All the scripts work except for `percent_meter.nu`. If you find otherwise, please report it as an issue.  99.9% of these script have to deal with ansi coloring. I picked anis coloring as a platform because I'm interested in coloring in the terminal and it was something that is pretty easily portable between shells.

Have fun!
